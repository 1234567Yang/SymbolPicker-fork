# SymbolPicker
A Simple Symbol Picker app like the Windows Emoji Picker to search and copy symbols to the clipboard.

It's basically a simple Symbol Picker like the Windows Emoji Picker. You can search for Symbols and then copy them to your clipboard.

The Windows Emoji Picker does have symbols on it but only problem is we cannot search through them. I searched for something and couldn't find one so I challenged myself to make my first useful app.

I used WinForms to do this because it was fairly easy to make this. So no fancy UI, but I have ideas of improving the UI to look like a modern app.

There is a text file where you can add your own symbols as unicode. I haven't added all the symbols in the world because I wanted to add only the ones I use personally. But since this is now public, I will update it soon.

I only have 5 symbols just for illustrating how the app works and how you can add symbols to the app.
